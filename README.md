## Recent Improvements

### 1. User Attribution Features

#### Workflow Attribution User
- **Feature**: New field in workflow settings to specify attribution user
- **Implementation**: User autocomplete field with backend validation
- **Benefits**: Clean revision logs, proper change attribution
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `includes/menu/class-postprocessing-menu.php`
  - `includes/postprocessing/class-workflow-output-processor.php`
  - `assets/js/postprocessing-admin.js`
  - `assets/js/core/user-autocomplete.js`

#### Post Creation Attribution Fix
- **Issue**: Translated posts were attributed to system user instead of original author
- **Root Cause**: `post_author` field was not included in post creation array
- **Solution**: Modified `PolyTrans_Translation_Post_Creator::create_post()` to include original author
- **Benefits**: Proper author attribution from post creation, cleaner revision history
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `includes/receiver/managers/class-translation-post-creator.php`
  - `includes/receiver/managers/class-translation-metadata-manager.php`

### 2. Workflow Engine Enhancements

#### Context Updating Fix
- **Issue**: Subsequent workflow steps received stale data instead of updated values
- **Root Cause**: Execution context only updated in test mode, not production mode
- **Solution**: Updated context in both test and production modes, added database refresh
- **Benefits**: Proper data flow between workflow steps, correct step execution
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `includes/postprocessing/class-workflow-executor.php`
  - `includes/postprocessing/class-workflow-output-processor.php`

#### Action Counting Fix
- **Issue**: "Actions processed: 0" consistently shown in logs
- **Root Cause**: Data type mismatch between workflow executor and output processor
- **Solution**: Fixed executor to treat `processed_actions` as integer, not array
- **Benefits**: Accurate action counting, better debugging capability
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `includes/postprocessing/class-workflow-executor.php`

### 3. Performance & Reliability
- **Consolidated Logging**: Unified logging system across all components
- **Better Validation**: Enhanced input validation and error handling
- **Test Mode**: Comprehensive test mode for workflow validation
- **Debug Support**: Extensive debugging tools and logging

## REST API Endpoints

### Translation Endpoints
- **POST** `/wp-json/polytrans/v1/translation/translate` - Receive and process translation requests
- **POST** `/wp-json/polytrans/v1/translation/receive-post` - Receive completed translations

### Workflow Endpoints
- **POST** `/wp-json/polytrans/v1/workflows/test` - Test workflow execution
- **POST** `/wp-json/polytrans/v1/workflows/execute` - Execute workflow

### Authentication
All endpoints support configurable authentication:
- Bearer token in Authorization header
- Custom header (x-polytrans-secret)
- POST parameter

## Hooks and Filters

### Actions
- `polytrans_translation_before_create` - Before creating translated post
- `polytrans_translation_after_create` - After creating translated post
- `polytrans_translation_status_updated` - When translation status changes
- `polytrans_workflow_before_execute` - Before workflow execution
- `polytrans_workflow_after_execute` - After workflow execution

### Filters
- `polytrans_register_providers` - Register custom translation providers
- `polytrans_translation_allowed_meta_keys` - Modify allowed meta keys for translation
- `polytrans_translation_post_data` - Modify post data before creating translation
- `polytrans_translation_email_content` - Customize notification email content
- `polytrans_workflow_context` - Modify workflow execution context
- `polytrans_workflow_steps` - Register custom workflow step types

## Security Considerations

### User Context Management
- User context switching only occurs during actual execution (not test mode)
- Original user context is always restored after workflow completion
- Comprehensive logging of all user context changes
- Validation of attribution user existence and permissions

### AJAX Security
- All AJAX endpoints require proper nonce verification
- User permission validation on all administrative functions
- Secure user search with capability restrictions

### API Security
- Configurable authentication methods for REST endpoints
- IP-based access restrictions
- Request validation and sanitization

## Testing

### Test Suite Location
All test files are located in `/tests/` directory:
- `test-attribution-user.php` - User attribution features
- `test-post-attribution.php` - Post creation attribution
- `test-context-updating.php` - Workflow context updating
- `test-actions-count.php` - Action counting validation
- `test-workflow-output.php` - Workflow execution testing
- And more...

### Running Tests
Tests can be run individually by accessing them through WordPress admin or web interface:
```
http://yoursite.com/wp-content/plugins/polytrans/tests/test-attribution-user.php
```
