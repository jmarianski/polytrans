I need to continue development on the PolyTrans WordPress plugin. The project has a complete self-contained documentation system for context-free continuation.

Please:

1. Read the current state from POLYTRANS_STATUS.md in the plugin directory
2. Check QUICK_START.md for immediate orientation  
3. Review TASK_QUEUE.md for prioritized next steps
4. Verify the development environment: `make phpcs-syntax` (should pass with 0 errors)
5. Check current issues: `make phpcs-relaxed` (should show ~93 security issues)

The plugin has complete Docker-based development infrastructure with these commands:
- `make setup` - Environment setup
- `make phpcs-syntax` - Syntax check (currently passes)  
- `make phpcs-relaxed` - Security-focused check (~93 issues to fix)
- `make phpcs` - Full WordPress standards
- `make phpcbf` - Auto-fix issues

Choose the next development focus:
- SECURITY (recommended): Fix 37 critical issues in includes/settings/class-translation-settings.php
- FEATURES: Continue functionality development
- STANDARDS: WordPress.org compliance preparation

All documentation is self-contained. Update CODE_QUALITY_STATUS.md with progress.
