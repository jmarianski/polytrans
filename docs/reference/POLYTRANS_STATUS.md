# PolyTrans Plugin: Self-Contained Development Continuation System

## Purpose
This document provides a complete, context-independent system for continuing PolyTrans plugin development. Any AI assistant can use this document to understand the current state and continue development without prior conversation context.

## Current Plugin State (As of July 10, 2025)

### âœ… Completed Infrastructure
- **Development Environment**: Docker-based, working
- **Code Quality Tools**: Multiple levels (syntax, security, full standards)
- **Project Files**: All essential files created
- **Bug Fixes**: Critical JavaScript bug fixed
- **Documentation**: Complete development guides

### ðŸ“Š Current Quality Status
- **Syntax Errors**: 0 (all files pass syntax check)
- **Security Issues**: 93 identified (37 critical in settings file)
- **WordPress Standards**: Many formatting violations (expected)
- **Test Coverage**: 0% (infrastructure ready)

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Priority Areas (In Order)
1. **Security Fixes** (37 critical issues in settings)
2. **Input Validation** (56 sanitization issues)
3. **Output Escaping** (remaining security issues)
4. **Testing Implementation** (0% to 80% coverage)
5. **WordPress Standards** (formatting compliance)

## Self-Contained Continuation Protocol

### Step 1: Environment Verification
```bash
# Verify Docker environment is working
cd /path/to/polytrans/plugin
make setup
make phpcs-syntax  # Should pass with 0 errors
```

### Step 2: Current State Assessment
```bash
# Check current quality status
make phpcs-relaxed  # Shows security issues (currently 93)
```

### Step 3: Priority Selection
Choose next development focus based on available time and priorities:

#### Option A: Security-First (Recommended)
- **Focus**: Fix critical security violations
- **Files**: `includes/core/class-translation-settings.php` (37 issues)
- **Validation**: `make phpcs-relaxed`

#### Option B: Feature Development
- **Focus**: New functionality
- **Validation**: `make phpcs-syntax` (syntax only)
- **Trade-off**: Ignore security issues temporarily

#### Option C: Standards Compliance
- **Focus**: WordPress.org readiness
- **Validation**: `make phpcs` (full standards)
- **Note**: Will show many formatting issues

## Critical File Locations

### Essential Files for Context
- `IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` - Strategic roadmap
- `CODE_QUALITY_STATUS.md` - Current technical status
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` - Development workflow
- `composer.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `Makefile` - Development commands

### High-Priority Files Needing Fixes
1. `includes/core/class-translation-settings.php` (37 security issues)
2. `includes/class-polytrans.php` (12 security issues)
3. `includes/core/class-logs-manager.php` (7 security issues)

### Working Development Commands
```bash
make setup           # One-time setup
make phpcs-syntax    # Quick syntax check (currently passes)
make phpcs-relaxed   # Security-focused check (93 issues)
make phpcs           # Full WordPress standards
make phpcbf          # Auto-fix what's possible
make test            # Run tests (when available)
make shell           # Open development environment
```

## Documented Issues Summary

### Critical Security Issues (Priority 1)
- **37 issues** in `includes/core/class-translation-settings.php`
  - Missing nonce verification for form processing
  - Unvalidated $_POST data usage
  - Missing wp_unslash() before sanitization

### Medium Security Issues (Priority 2)
- **56 issues** across multiple files
  - Input sanitization problems
  - Output escaping missing
  - $_GET/$POST validation issues

### WordPress Standards Issues (Priority 3)
- Many formatting violations (tabs vs spaces, etc.)
- These can be partially auto-fixed with `make phpcbf`

## Architecture Overview
- **Main Plugin File**: `polytrans.php`
- **Core Classes**: `includes/class-polytrans.php`
- **Modular System**: Provider-based translation architecture
- **Frontend**: JavaScript in `assets/js/`
- **Menu**: `includes/menu/` (admin interface components)
- **Core**: `includes/core/` (WordPress integration and settings)
- **Providers**: `includes/providers/` (Google, OpenAI)

# CONTINUATION PROMPT TEMPLATE

Use this exact prompt to continue development:

```
I need to continue development on the PolyTrans WordPress plugin. Please:

1. Read the self-contained status from POLYTRANS_STATUS.md
2. Verify the development environment works: `make phpcs-syntax` (should pass)
3. Check current issues: `make phpcs-relaxed` (should show ~93 security issues)
4. Focus on [CHOOSE ONE]:
   - SECURITY: Fix critical issues in includes/core/class-translation-settings.php
   - FEATURES: Add new functionality (use syntax-only checking)
   - STANDARDS: WordPress.org compliance (full standards)

The plugin has complete Docker development infrastructure. Use the established workflow and update progress in CODE_QUALITY_STATUS.md.

Priority files needing attention:
- includes/core/class-translation-settings.php (37 security issues)
- includes/class-polytrans.php (12 security issues)  
- includes/core/class-logs-manager.php (7 security issues)
