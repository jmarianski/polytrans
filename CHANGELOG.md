### 🎉 Major Release: PSR-4 Architecture Migration

This release represents a **complete architectural refactoring** of the PolyTrans plugin to modern PHP standards (PSR-4). All 60+ classes have been migrated to namespaced structure with full backward compatibility.

### Added - PSR-4 Architecture

- **Complete PSR-4 Migration**: All classes now follow PSR-4 autoloading standard
  - Base namespace: `PolyTrans\`
  - Organized into logical modules: `Assistants\`, `Core\`, `Debug\`, `Menu\`, `PostProcessing\`, `Providers\`, `Receiver\`, `Scheduler\`, `Templating\`
  - Zero manual `require_once` statements (except WordPress core)
  - Composer-based autoloading for all classes
  
- **Three-Tier Autoloading System**:
  1. Composer Autoloader - Vendor dependencies (Twig, etc.)
  2. PSR-4 Autoloader - Namespaced classes (`PolyTrans\*`)
  3. LegacyAutoloader - Temporary backward compatibility (empty, will be removed)

- **Backward Compatibility Layer**: 
  - All old class names still work via aliases (e.g., `PolyTrans_Workflow_Manager` → `PolyTrans\PostProcessing\WorkflowManager`)
  - Zero breaking changes for existing code
  - Seamless upgrade path

- **New Directory Structure**:
  ```
  includes/
  ├── Assistants/          # PolyTrans\Assistants\
  ├── Core/                # PolyTrans\Core\

- **Context Variable Updates**: Fixed `translated.meta` not being updated after `update_post_meta` action, enabling subsequent steps to access meta values via `{{ translated.meta.KEY }}`
- **Workflow Sanitization**: Added missing sanitization case for `managed_assistant` step type, fixing issue where `assistant_id` was stripped during workflow save
- **Assistant Migration**: Fixed critical bugs in workflow migration from `ai_assistant` to `managed_assistant`:
  - Correctly separate system prompt and user message based on delimiter
  - Properly handle WP_Error returns from Assistant_Manager
  - Update workflow array reference (not just local variable) when converting steps
  - Cast API parameters to correct types (int for max_tokens, float for temperature/top_p)

### Improved
- **OpenAI Error Logging**: Detailed error codes and messages for translation failures
  - Now shows specific error codes (rate_limit_exceeded, insufficient_quota, server_error, etc.)
  - Includes human-readable error messages from OpenAI API
  - Structured logging with error_code, error_details, thread_id, run_id
  - **Before**: "OpenAI: step 0 failed (de -> en): Run ended with status: failed"
  - **After**: "OpenAI: step 0 failed (de -> en) [code: rate_limit_exceeded]: Run ended with status: failed - Rate limit reached for requests"
  - Makes debugging translation failures much faster (instantly see if it's rate limiting, insufficient funds, timeout, etc.)
  - See: `docs/ERROR_LOGGING_IMPROVEMENTS.md` for full details and error code reference

### Added (Phase 1 - Complete)
- **AI Assistants Management System**: Complete implementation with Admin UI and Workflow integration
  
  **Backend Infrastructure:**
  - `wp_polytrans_assistants` table for centralized assistant configurations
  - `PolyTrans_Assistant_Manager`: Full CRUD operations (26 unit tests ✅)
  - `PolyTrans_Assistant_Executor`: Execute assistants with Twig variable interpolation (27 unit tests ✅)
  - Support for OpenAI Chat Completions API (Claude and Gemini placeholders)
  - Text and JSON response formats with validation
  - Comprehensive error handling (rate limiting, timeouts, API errors)
  
  **Admin UI (PolyTrans > AI Assistants):**
  - List view with assistant details (name, provider, model, response format, created date)
  - Create/Edit assistant form with:
    - Name, provider (OpenAI/Claude/Gemini), model dropdown with "Use Global Setting" option
    - **Separate editors** for System Instructions and User Message Template
    - Prompt template editor with Twig syntax and variable pills
    - Response format (text/json)
    - Configuration (temperature, max_tokens, top_p)
  - Delete assistant with confirmation
  - Test assistant functionality with sample variables
  - Beautiful, responsive interface matching WordPress admin design
  - Shared CSS/JS components with workflow editor for consistency
  
  **Workflow Integration:**
  - New step type: "Managed AI Assistant" (managed_assistant)
  - Uses assistants configured in Admin UI
  - Automatic Twig variable interpolation from workflow context
  - Dropdown selector showing all available assistants with model info
  - Backward compatible with existing workflow steps
  - AJAX endpoint for loading managed assistants in workflow editor
  - **Automatic Migration**: Existing `ai_assistant` steps are automatically converted to `managed_assistant` on plugin activation/update
  - Migration creates managed assistants from old step configs and updates workflows
  - Manual migration trigger available in AI Assistants admin page
  
  **Benefits:**
  - ✅ Centralized management - configure once, use everywhere
  - ✅ Multi-provider support - OpenAI, Claude, Gemini (extensible)
  - ✅ Twig templates - powerful variable interpolation
  - ✅ Reusable - same assistant in multiple workflows
  - ✅ Testable - test assistants before using in production
  - ✅ Maintainable - update assistant prompts without editing workflows

## [1.3.5] - 2025-12-10
