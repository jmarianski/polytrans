# PolyTrans Processed Actions Count Fix

## Issue Summary

The workflow executor was consistently showing "Actions processed: 0" in logs and results, even when output actions were successfully executing. This made it difficult to track and debug workflow performance.

## Root Cause

The issue was a **data type mismatch** between the workflow executor and output processor:

### Output Processor (Correct)
```php
// Returns processed_actions as integer
return [
    'success' => empty($errors),
    'processed_actions' => $processed_actions, // INTEGER (e.g., 3)
    'errors' => $errors,
    'changes' => $changes,
    'updated_context' => $updated_context
];
```

### Workflow Executor (Incorrect)
```php
// Expected array but got integer
$processed_actions = $output_result['processed_actions'] ?? [];
$actions_processed = is_array($processed_actions) ? count($processed_actions) : 0;
```

**Result**: Since `processed_actions` was an integer (not an array), the executor would default to 0.

## Solution

Fixed the workflow executor to treat `processed_actions` as an integer:

```php
// Fixed code
$actions_processed = $output_result['processed_actions'] ?? 0;
$output_processing_info = " (processed {$actions_processed} actions)";
```

## Files Modified

- **`includes/postprocessing/class-workflow-executor.php`** (lines 173-176)
  - Changed from treating `processed_actions` as array to integer
  - Simplified the logic to directly use the count

## Testing

Created `test-actions-count.php` to validate:
1. **Multiple Actions**: Workflow with 3 output actions (title, content, excerpt)
2. **Test Mode**: Verifies correct count in simulation mode
3. **Production Mode**: Verifies correct count in actual execution mode
4. **Direct Testing**: Tests output processor directly

## Expected Results

- **Before Fix**: Always showed "Actions processed: 0"
- **After Fix**: Shows correct count (e.g., "Actions processed: 3")

## Benefits

- ✅ **Accurate Reporting**: Correct action counts in logs and results
- ✅ **Better Debugging**: Can see exactly how many actions were processed
- ✅ **Performance Tracking**: Monitor workflow efficiency
- ✅ **Error Detection**: Easier to spot when expected actions don't execute

## Compatibility

- **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes to existing workflows
- **Data Integrity**: Only affects reporting, not actual execution
- **Minimal Impact**: Single line change with immediate effect
